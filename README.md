The Token Wallet Balance Checker project involves creating a tool or application that allows users to check the balance of a specific ERC-20 token held in their Ethereum wallet address. This is particularly useful for users who want to quickly verify the amount of a particular token they possess without accessing a full-fledged wallet interface.

Project Description:
The goal is to build a simple interface where users can input an Ethereum wallet address and the contract address of the ERC-20 token. Upon submission, the application will query the Ethereum blockchain and retrieve the token balance associated with that wallet address for the specified token contract.
